# Factorywars

Factorywars is a game which is inspired of the indie game Factorio, but we aim to make it a lot more focused on the multiplayer and PvP experience. It is released under GPLv3.


## Current progress

Currenly, the game is under heavy development. It isn't playable yet.

## Developer crew

We are a group of 3 friends from France, and created this project as a college work, but we are motivated to pursue its development after the college project is over. We do not have much experience nor knowledge in advanced programming or math algorithms but we are very motivated, and try to figure out every one of the issues, by learning how things works.
